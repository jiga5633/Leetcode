Problem-solving ideas:
1. Find the midpoint of the interval mid
2. Sort [l, mid] and [mid+1, r]
3. Merge [l, mid] and [mid+1, r]

Time complexity analysis:
The time complexity of merge sort is O(nlogn2)

Given you a length n
  array of integers.

Please use merge sort to sort this array from smallest to largest.

And output the sorted array in order.

input format
Input a total of two lines, the first line contains the integer n.

The second line contains n integers (all integers between 1∼109 range), 
representing the entire array.

output format
Output a total of one line, containing n
  An integer representing a sorted array.

data range
1≤n≤100000

Input sample:
5
3 1 2 4 5
Sample output:
1 2 3 4 5
