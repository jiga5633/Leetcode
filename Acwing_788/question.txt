Given a length n
  Integer sequence of , please count the number of reverse pairs in the sequence.

The inverse pair is defined as follows: For the i-th
  and the jth
  elements, if i<j
  And a[i]>a[j]
, then it is a reverse pair; otherwise it is not.

input format
The first line contains the integer n
, indicating the length of the array.

The second line contains n
  An integer representing the entire array.

output format
Output an integer representing the number of reversed pairs.

data range
1≤n≤100000
,
The value range of the elements in the array [1,109]
.

Input sample:
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
Sample output:
5
